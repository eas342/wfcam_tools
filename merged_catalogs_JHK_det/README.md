## Down-selected Merged Catalogs

This directory has has combined catalogs for the J, H and K data. The initial catalog was made for J-band data and then cross-matched to the other two bands.

This is similar to ../merged_catalogs but only includes rows with detections in all 3 bands.

There are FITS and CSV versions
